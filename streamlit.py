We look at the difference between the desired temperature and the current temperature, the so-called error. If the error is large and positive (desired temperature > current temperature) we choose $u$ to be large and positive. This will heat up the solar panel and the error will go down. The more the error goes down, the more we would turn the $u$-knob towards zero. If the error is negative, i.e., the current solar panel temperature is too high (dangerous for the photovoltaic cell!), we would like to cool the panel down by setting $u$ to a negative value. Unfortunately, this is something we cannot do with our electrical heater. ")

    st.markdown("In a real system it can be hard to understand why there is a *steady state error*, because we might not even have a model of the system. For our simulated solar panel system however, we can understand it: Assume that the actual temperature is equal to the desired temperature. Then the error `T_desired-T` is zero and hence `u=K_d * (T_desired-T)` is zero. This means no heat is added and the solar panel cools down below `T==T_desired`. A steady state is reached when the heat generated by the error is equal to the heat that is lost to the room. ")
